# Freshers' Selection

## How do we recruit?

I propose simply inviting the members who actively participate and show an interest in our events, this seems sufficient for now. We can add the other things from below once we actually have people.

---

> This should be carefully re-evaluated every year. People change, along with the needs of KGP-Speedcubers.

Core parameters for hiring are

- Knowledge
- Will to Learn
- Will to Teach

The parameters are given equal weight.

### Mailing

All the mails sent during the selection process are sent using the [mailing-scripts](https://github.com/KGP-Speedcubers/mailing-scripts). It already has all of the templates of the mail which are to be sent during any round.

> **Warning** You must first test the scripts before sending the mails officially.

### Screening Round

An online form is released with few questionnaires. We carefully go through their answers and invite potential candidates for a sit-in interview with the team. We do this to focus more on the interviews with the eligible candidates.

Questions on the form for screening round -

* Name
* Roll Number
* Email ID
* Phone
* Share with us your URLs (GitHub, portfolio, any projects, etc.)
* Do you have any achievements you want us to know?
* What are you learning these days?
* What other societies/clubs/fests are you a part of or you want to be? How long have you been there? What are your opinions about them?
* Why do you want to join KGP-Speedcubers? What are your expectations?
* Enlist all of your interactions with the KGP-Speedcubers community over the year
* Any comments?

### Interview Round

We form a few panels consisting of 3-5 people. Each panel should have at least one advisor. The interviewers evaluate them during the conversation. If a candidate does not have any projects done so far, a task must be given to check code quality. The tasks are on spot or to be completed within 24 hours.

## Panel Discussion and the release of results

We all meet a few days after the interview round and discuss each potential candidate. A Physical meeting is required before finalizing the list of new members.

## Guidelines

* Have a physical meeting to discuss the selection of freshers every year.
* Make sure the form reaches all the freshers. Good marketing is recommended.
* Make the students comfortable during the interview. Freshers can get nervous and you may not get to know them completely.
* For on-spot tasks, judge by their effort.
* Give the interviewees an experience to remember. Talk politely and be curious in them.
* It is important that the panelists write detailed comments for every candidate after their interview. This helps in judging them later.
* Do not share the Sheets (responses, interview comments, etc.) with KGP-Speedcubers internet accounts. Maintain them on personal accounts. There is no need to archive them.
* Do not share Sheets with the link (use email addresses to add collaborators). Limit possibility of the new members viewing the sheets in the future.
* Do not discuss selections on public channels on Slack or Google Group.

### Red Flags

**What do we mean by Red Flags?**

> If you spot a red flag, you say No at the very moment. No second thoughts or arguments.
> The Red flags listed below do not mean they are bad qualities as a human being. They only mean that the person is not a cultural fit for KGP-Speedcubers.

* Mentions disinterest in Teaching.
* Mentions disinterest in Learning.
* No idea what Speedcubing is (little knowledge is not a red flag, however coming for selections without having read anything is)

### Positive points

* Follows KGP-Speedcubers, already in touch with any of its members
* Passion
* Self-confidence
* Good at cubing (not necessary though)
* Has a WCA ID and has participated in competitions
* Has actual WCA organisation experience
* ultimate is if they are a WCA delegate already XD

### Negative points

* Inability to express or communicate clearly

Note: Negative points differ from Red Flags. A Red Flag is too serious to consider. However, negative points do not indicate rejecting a candidate. The interviewers need to make extra effort in understand the interviewee. They may also require extra attention from the Executives/Advisors to align with our ideologies.

## FAQs

### Why do we hold selections in the spring semester?

To give students an opportunity to attend events conducted by us like workshops and competitions!

## Can we recruit second-year students as well?

Yes, absolutely! A few of KGP-Speedcubers members joined in their second year. However, it should be done as early as possible (in their Autumn semester). We should not hire second year students in their spring semester because that would create a whole lot of difference in the batch, which soon would become Executives.

## What is the ideal number of students to recruit?

A batch with more than 15 people is hard to manage. Increasing the team size makes it difficult to have like-minded people in the entire team across all the batches. Also, we should not be doing anything which requires the involvement of more than 15 people in every batch.
