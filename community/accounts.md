# Accounts
This document describes all the financial and accounting content related to KGP Speedcubers. This particular function has to be carried out with the very high standards and utmost sincerity.

## Why does KGP Speedcubers require money?

We conduct various workshops and events which require multiple costs like AV Cell booking, room booking, posters, (domain hosting, servers?), equipment etc. To pay for the costs, the members had donated various sums of money to sustain the society while finding some self-funding source so as to continue the society in perpetuity without much financial strain on it’s individual members.


## What is that self-funding source?

[WIP 
1. Mosaics at fests is a good idea imo
2. Sponsors
]

## What is the goal of receiving donations?

To get enough money to sustain society and pay for various costs in conducting the events.


## What isn’t the goal of receiving donations?

The money which we receive should never be used for internal parties/treats. The reason is simple: we don’t want to conduct events because we have the end goal of partying (which happens in majority places). Also, we think it’s a very healthy culture of seniors treating juniors and should continue.
