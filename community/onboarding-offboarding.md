# Onboarding/Offboarding

## How to onboard someone in KGP Speedcubers?
1. Add them to the “Newbies” GitHub team.
1. Add them to the Discord. Make them install the Discord desktop and mobile apps and enable notifications to not miss out any important updates.
1. Create a private Discord channel named `kgp-speedcubers-xx` (where `xx` are the last two digits of the batch year) and all new members to it. Leave the channel once all new members join.
1. Create a private Discord channel named `a-b-c-d` where each of the letters represents the full name of one member of each of the four batches on campus. Add all on-campus KGP Speedcubers members(CTMs + Executives + Advisors) to this channel. This will be used as the main medium of communication for shop talk.
1. Add their contact details on https://github.com/KGP-Speedcubers/secrets.
1. Assign their 1:1 group.
1. Add their name to the website. [WIP]

1. Make them store numbers of everyone in team using the automatically generated VCFs in the secrets repository.
1. Ask them to create their batch's private Whatsapp group and add it to the "KGP Speedcubers" community. [I don't likw whatsapp communities]
1. Create a Whatsapp group with the Executives + CTMs and name it `KGP Speedcubers XX` where `XX` is the sum of the last two digits of the batch years of the executives and CTMs. Eg: Batch of '21 and batch of '22 will have a whatsapp group named `KGP Speedcubers 43`. (Credits to [@rakaar](https://github.com/rakaar) for the naming scheme).
1. Create a Whatsapp group with all the on-campus advisors (Last two batches, B.Tech and Dual), Executives, and CTMs, and name it `KGP Speedcubers XX` where `XX` is the sum of the last two digits of their batch years.
1. Add both of the above groups to the `KGP Speedcubers` Whatsapp community.
1. The purpose of the Whatsapp groups is promotions, bakaar, and motivation to use Discord. It will be an unofficial platform for communcation. This should be made clear to the new members and they should be encouraged to use Discord as the main medium of communication.

## Why do we lay off some members? What are the reasons?

A bad influence justifies bad turn of events in the future. They will recruit similar kind of people. New Core Team Members will start following them. Hence, we can not be passive about the membership of a CTM. We have to make sure we purge any unwanted behavior in time. Hence, it is important that we keep the doors open for uncompatible individuals in order to preserve KGP Speedcubers culture and essence.

We totally understand that it is natural for folks for having change of plans after 2 years in KGP, and we should be really clear about the fact that we want motivated/passionate folks, who can stick for KGP Speedcubers and are enthusiastic/interested in cubing. Folks who are not aligned with this thought, would be a poor addition to the executives/advisors, so it makes sense for keeping like minded people in the batch. Brings down the moral, and makes it difficult to believe in the responsibilities, because they can always find a person, who is not having same level of commitment.

1. If they do not align with our vision.
1. If they often do not show up in Meetings, Discord, or E-mails.
1. If they never take ownership of KGP Speedcubers.
1. If they repeatatively do not care about how our meetings or events happen in their absense.
1. If they never take leadership of KGP Speedcubers. If they never take any initiatives or never took part in any initiative by one of their batchmates.
1. If they depend upon their batchmates all the time. If they never volunteer and take up any work by their own.
1. If they clearly feel or state that they do not belong here and are not interested in committing their time to KGP Speedcubers...

Note: One semester may not be enough to judge. Preferably do it after [Governance Review Week](/community/governance-review-week.md).
