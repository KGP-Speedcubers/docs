# About KGP Speedcubers

* We are a bunch of Speedcubing enthuasists, who love to share the culture of speedcubing. Through events and workshops, we try to share the different aspects of speedcubing!
  
* We love to improve our cubing skills, and help others do the same. We are always exploring new ideas in speedcubing and discussing our ideas with each other!

* We are known for conducting regular competitions in IITKGP for everyone to be able to showcase their expertise and the results of their practise! You can view more about the events we conduct at [page](/events/git-and-github.md).

* We inculcate an environment, where each of us work on anything that we might want to learn, and in return you would get fantastic mentors on the subject matter. Want to improve at Megaminx?

## What do we do?  

> Thanks for asking this question! This sets up the expectations from KGP Speedcubers as a society :) 
 
* We are a college society to spread the culture of speedcubing!

* We conduct workshops and events to share the culture of speedcubing with the KGP folks.

* We conduct IIT Kharagur Spring Open every year where we invite people from all around the world to compete in World Cube Association Official Competition!

* Check out our social media links for getting an idea about the content we share with the KGP folks - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kgpspeedcubers/about)

## What do we NOT do?

* Avoid joining KGP Speedcubers if you want a POR. Effectively, KGP Speedcubers might not add any value to your resume, if you are looking to join KGP Speedcubers for the purpose of POR. KGP Speedcubers helps you to develop your speedcubing skills purely because we love speedcubing and the speedcubing community. Do join if you are interested in the Rubik's Cube at all and want to be part of a global community of speedcubers!

* We can't force anyone to practise. In the end no matter how much you learn, the only way to improve at cubing is by practise. Erno Rubik once said that cubing is unique and beautiful in the way it is an almost exact blend of art of science, of physical and mental ability. Essentially we are not responsible for your lack of improvement if you don't practise.
