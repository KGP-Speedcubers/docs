# About KGP Speedcubers

* We are a bunch of Speedcubing enthuasists, who love to share the culture of speedcubing. Through events and workshops, we try to share the different aspects of speedcubing!
  
* We are known for conducting regular competitions in IITKGP for everyone to be able to showcase their expertise and the results of their practise! You can view more about the events we conduct at [page](/events/git-and-github.md).

* We inculcate an environment, where each of us work on anything that we might want to learn, and in return you would get fantastic mentors on the subject matter. Want to improve at Megaminx?

## What do we NOT do?

* We can't force anyone to practise. In the end no matter how much you learn, the only way to improve at cubing is by practise. Erno Rubik once said that cubing is unique and beautiful in the way it is an almost exact blend of art of science, of physical and mental ability.
