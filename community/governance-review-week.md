# Governance Review Week

## What is it?

It is a week dedicated to the Governance of KGP Speedcubers.

Our intention behind organizing the Governance Review Week is to help the core team members measure their level of involvement in KGP Speedcubers. The week also promotes open discussions between Seniors and the Core team members. We want each one of our members to be frank with their batchmates as well as seniors in sharing their opinions and perspective on every aspect of KGP Speedcubers.

We also review how KGP Speedcubers performed as a team in the past year. We identify our problems and discuss solutions. We want to make sure we eliminate all forms of toxicity from KGP Speedcubers (It can be habits of how we do things, or some Core Team members themselves.)

## What is the structure and timeline?

We physically meet for 3-5 days for 3-4 hours each day. We put up few questions in advance and the Core Team Members have to think and give their answers or their take on the subject. All the second years individually speak for a few minutes. The time limit is decided and followed. We later discuss the answers given by the CTMs. The members send their answers on the Google Group thread of the day. The sessions are recorded and put up on our archives.

## What happens after this week?

Executive Heads discuss the involvement and membership of each Core Team member. If they find someone not being a good fit to continue, this is the time when the team is updated and they are laid off (See [Onboarding/Offboarding](/community/onboarding-offboarding.md)).

After the week, Core Team members become the new Executive Heads and Executive Members (See [Governance](/community/governance.md)), quickly followed by an (Introductory Seminar?) and the [Selection of new members](/events/freshers-selection.md).

A new version of KGP Speedcubers Documentation is released. It is suggested to scrutinise everything which is written over here. Detailed changelog should be published which answers, "What changed and Why?", "What things worked out really well?", "What more should be written?", etc. Alumni of KGP Speedcubers will receive the changelog via email, and it will be published in the repository as well.


## Why do we do this?

- Evaluation. We want Core team members to review their year and contributions to KGP Speedcubers
- Executive Heads want to understand the priorities and values of the new batch. They form the questions to do so.
- This is a great time to know and identify potential Executive Heads on an individual level.
- Self-awareness of all the members.
- Questioning the principles of KGP Speedcubers. We discuss and make serious policy changes to how things are done.
