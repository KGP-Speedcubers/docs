- Long links should be shortened using a tool such as https://bit.ly.
- Whatsapp guidelines:
    - The image has to have a 1:1 ratio to be properly displayed in messages without clicking.
    - [This](https://pinetools.com/blurred-frame-images-generator) tool may be used to add blurred borders to the image to make it 1:1.
    - The Whatsapp channel may be used for sharing posts regarding KGP-Speedcubers events as well as important speedcubing news (eg: World Records or National records) or interesting articles to keep the community engaged. Do not share too many posts as it leads to spam.

- Each reshare suggestion **must** be discussed with other team members on Discord before posting it on any platform. The suggestion must be approved by at least *one executive and one advisor*.
- The repost must link back to the original post.
- Platform wise Guidelines:
    - On Facebook:
        - "Share to Feed": Share with a caption.
        - "Share Now": Share without a caption.
